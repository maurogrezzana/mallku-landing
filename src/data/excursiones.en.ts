      'This excursion takes you through over a thousand years of Andean history in a single day. We begin in the Tafi Valley, where the Tafi culture left its mark in the form of mysterious stone menhirs, monoliths that still hold secrets about their rituals and worldview.',
      'We cross the Abra del Infiernillo at over 3,000 meters above sea level, a mountain pass that connects two worlds: the humid yungas and the dry Calchaqui valleys. The landscape changes dramatically as we descend toward Quilmes.',
      'Quilmes was the largest city in pre-Hispanic northwestern Argentina. Its inhabitants resisted Spanish conquest for over 130 years, standing as the last bastion of Calchaqui resistance. Walking among its terraces is walking through the living history of a people that never surrendered.'
